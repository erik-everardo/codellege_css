            <h3>Tokyo</h3>
            <p class="texto-principal">
                Tokyo is the de facto capital and most populous prefecture of Japan. Located at the head of Tokyo Bay,
                the prefecture forms part of the Kantō region on the central Pacific coast of Japan’s main island of
                Honshu. Tokyo is the political and economic center of the country, as well as the seat of the Emperor of
                Japan and the national government. As of 2021, the prefecture has an estimated population of
                13,960,236. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with more
                than 37.393 million residents as of 2020.

                Originally a fishing village, named Edo, the city became a prominent political center in 1603, when it
                became the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo was one of the most populous
                cities in the world at over one million. Following the end of the shogunate in 1868, the imperial
                capital in Kyoto was moved to the city, which was renamed Tokyo (literally "eastern capital"). Tokyo was
                devastated by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, and again by Allied bombing raids during World War II.
                Beginning in the 1950s, the city underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion, going on to lead Japan's
                post-war economic recovery. Since 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the
                prefecture's 23 special wards (formerly Tokyo City), various bed towns in the western area, and two
                outlying island chains.
